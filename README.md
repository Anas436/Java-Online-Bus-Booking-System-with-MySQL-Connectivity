### Login Form
________________________

A login form is a set of credentials used to authenticate a user. Most often, these consist of a username and password but also here I have added user role which will help to find out right user. Also here I have set the login notification which will notify individually to the user whether he/she has given wrong password or wrong username. If one is wrong he/she will not be able to enter. And here has the user role that needs to be fixed. 

__________________________
### Registration Form
__________________________

A registration form is a list of fields that a user will input data into and submit to an individual. Most often, these consist of users basic information which will help to identify proper user. Here, I have taken some common information which is needed for each and every user. If one fields there blank instantly this system inform you so that you can not blank any fields. Also, I have attached user role which is very much important portion of this system when you can registration must be choice carefully.

### User Bus Booking System
________________________
This is the main part of this system. Here in this panel only will get permission an users and other person not get permission to entry. Also, user can be book tickets using their interested schedule and user can be check has any bus schedule availability. If their wanted bus schedule is available then they can book their tickets at any times. When they want to book tickets their first need to filled up their personal information like customer name, mobile no and destination these are most vital data for any user. 
Also when can check user their interested schedule they can be see their bus tickets availability. When they can select their perfect seat instantly their choosen information will be added through bus tickets booking data. If bus tickets is not available in their choosen time then system can notify user tickets is not available that’s means all tickets has already booked. Additionally all data which are connected to the bus booking process these will be input in RDBMS.

### Admin Panel
___________________________

This is another important part of this system. This part contains so many values of this systems basically admin can be over control this system. Here I have included system configure operation through admin panel for this reason admin can be configure the whole user bus booking system. If admin does not configure this system then the whole process does not work properly.
Admin can be set up any schedule and bus when he want to control smartly this bus booking systems. He can be select bus destination which at any time needed for any user.
Also, I have included bus booking operation in the admin panel so that admin can be book tickets any times. When system will be configure then all user can be book their tickets at any time when they want their perfect choice. And all data will be input there RDBMS
